# Virtual-Layer-0
This is intended to be a starting point for a unreliable physical network that emulates a reliable virtual network. By doing so, permeant addresses are able to be routed to on the virtual network using traditional networking solutions. This would, in theory, permit a swarm to perform the function of an internet service provider.
